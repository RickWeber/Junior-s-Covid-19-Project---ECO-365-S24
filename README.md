# Junior's Covid-19 Project (ECO 365, S24)

This project aims to analyze the economic impact of COVID-19 measures across different regions. First of all, I loaded the COVID-19 from a CSV files, then processed it to calculate the total cost measure per region and performed various analysis.

1) Data loading: I loaded the COVID-19 data, converted date column to appropriate format, and handle missing values.
 2) Calculating Total COVID-19 cost I calculated the total COVID-19 cost measure by adding up various economic support measures, fiscal measures, international support, Healthcare investment, vaccine investment and government response index. 
 3) Analysis: I created a bar plot to compare the total COVID-19 cost measure, identify economic impact of the pandemic on different economies, and also created multiple maps.
4)  Interactive Visualization:  I created an interactive map using Leaflet to visualize the total COVID-19 cost measure across countries, providing more insights and a better understanding. 
 
What I have learned:  By doing the project, I have learned a lot in data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis techniques. You can learn from this project by understanding how to analyze and interpret the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using other data. 
Besides that, you can gain insight into the importance of data driven decisions during time of crisis. You can also apply the same manipulation to other data and provide powerful information.
